## Evaluation Metrics in IR (information retrieval) tasks

Evaluation measures commonly used in IR domain are implemented in Python, which
includes:
- Precision
- Recall
- F-Measure
- (Mean) Average Precision at K
- DCG (Discounted Cumulative Gain)
- NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)

**current implementation status**

- precision
- recall
- f-measure
- average precision at k
- mean average precision at k
